# Instruction
1. Make Textfield to input the Fibonacci number and button to process those number. The output is a set of Fibonacci numbers in a Text.
2. Make Two Textfield to input a word in each and a button to process that input, to see whether the two inputs are Anagram or not. The output is a sentence that states whether the two inputs are Anagram or not in Text.
3. Make Two Textfield to input numbers, namely n and r, and a button to process n and r to calculate the results of permutation without repetition. The output is the result of the calculation in Text.
